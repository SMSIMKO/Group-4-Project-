The Coronavirus has transformed and altered life as we know it, impacting a wide array of markets across the World. One such market, the Housing Market, has experienced a profound change and destabilization throughout the Pandemic. We've identified **6 topics** and studied pre-Pandemic, during-Pandemic, and post-Pandemic data to truly analyze the Pandemic's impact on the Housing Market.

# Our Data:

![coronavirus-effect-on-housing-market](https://github.com/SMSIMKO/Group-4-Project-/assets/133065460/d675a4f8-0de1-45f4-bd09-95eebb80b90c)

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) decalred Covid-19 a pandemic. In order to assess Covid's impact on the Housing Market, we reasearched and found data leading up to, which we labeled as **" "pre-Pandemic"**, during Covid, labeled as **"during-Pandemic"**, and after Covid, which was labeled as **"post-Pandemic"**. 

On May 5, 2023, as the number of Covid-19 cases continued to dwindle, the WHO officially declared an end to Global Public Health Emergency (PHE) for Covid. The data we accumulated during the 3-year span of Covid fell into the **"during-Pandemic"** category. In order to show an equal representation of data, each "period" studied was for a 3-year span.

**"Pre-Pandemic** = March 2017 - March 2020

**"During-Pandemic"** = March 2020 - March 2023

**"Post-Pandemic"** = March 2023 - March 2026 (although data from March 2023-July 2023 was also taken into consideration during our calculation)
