The Coronavirus has transformed and altered life as we know it, impacting a wide array of markets across the World. One such market, the Housing Market, has experienced a profound change and destabilization throughout the Pandemic. We've identified **6 topics** and studied pre-Pandemic, during-Pandemic, and post-Pandemic data to truly analyze the Pandemic's impact on the Housing Market.

# Our Data:

![coronavirus-effect-on-housing-market](https://github.com/SMSIMKO/Group-4-Project-/assets/133065460/d675a4f8-0de1-45f4-bd09-95eebb80b90c)

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) decalred Covid-19 a pandemic. In order to assess Covid's impact on the Housing Market, we reasearched and found data leading up to, which we labeled as **" "pre-Pandemic"**, during Covid, labeled as **"during-Pandemic"**, and after Covid, which was labeled as **"post-Pandemic"**. 

On May 5, 2023, as the number of Covid-19 cases continued to dwindle, the WHO officially declared an end to Global Public Health Emergency (PHE) for Covid. The data we accumulated during the 3-year span of Covid fell into the **"during-Pandemic"** category. In order to show an equal representation of data, each "period" studied was for a 3-year span.

**"Pre-Pandemic** = March 2017 - March 2020

**"During-Pandemic"** = March 2020 - March 2023

**"Post-Pandemic"** = March 2023 - March 2026 (although data from March 2023-July 2023 was also taken into consideration during our calculation)

# Results

# 1) Interest Rates

For illustrative purposes, the below reflects the average monthly principal and interest payment for $250,000 house based upon the mean 30-year interest rate during each of the eras:

**Pre-Pandemic - Monthly P&I: $1,211.19 @ 4.12%**

**Pandemic: Monthly P&I: $1,185.01 @ 3.94%;**

**Post Pandemic: P&I $1,585.93 @ 6.53%;**

Our data shows that the Pandemic had a profound impact on the housing inventory, greatly limiting the number of homes that were available on the Market. Although the supply of homes decreased, the demand for homes steadily increased, further augmeting the price of homes during the Pandemic.

# 3) Median Home Price

As shown by the Housing Inventory, the Median Home Price also experienced a drastic increase in price throughout the Pandemic.

# Conclusion:

The pandemic has had a profound impact on the Housing Market. Although the Market has shown that it's working towards stabilizing, the economic impact of Covid has proven how volatile the Market can be. As the 30-year average mortgage interest rate climbed as did the median home price and rate of unemployment. As home prices continued to increase, and many potential homebuyers had less liquidity due to high interest rates, buyers were forced to bid on a diminished housing inventory, forcing them to "overpay" considerably and vastly decreasing the amount of time that a hosue was on the Market. These factors, amongst many others, greatly contributed to the extreme volatility of the Housing Market. Our data, which supports this claim, shows a direct correalation between these 6 contributing factors and truly explains each's overall impact on the Market.
